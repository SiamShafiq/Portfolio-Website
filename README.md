# Portfolio-Website

## Overview
Hi there, this is my personal custom portfolio. I built this using mostly HTML, CSS, and just the tiniest amount of JS for some of the animations. I tried making this as responsive as I could (to my knowledge) and I am continously pushing updates to make the experience even better. The design of the site is resume style, so it reads from top to bottom as you scroll. The site is currently hosted in the github pages link below.
